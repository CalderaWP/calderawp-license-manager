License Manager for CalderaWP Plugins -- provides a simple UI for activating and deactivating all CalderaWP plugins.

Moves all CalderaWP plugin licensing into one admin page. Easier for you, easier for us:)

This plugin is required for activating and deactivating licenses. It also enables updates via the WordPress plugin updater. Disabling this plugin disables the plugin updater, but does not disable the plugins licensed with it.

This plugin also provides beta updates for Caldera Forms.
